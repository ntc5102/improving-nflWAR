# improving-nflWAR
Repo created by Nathaniel Carson and Ben Cruciani in order to test feature reduction techniques as well as novelty analysis on nflWAR modeling for discovery and improvement.

These files are utilized in order to recreate the models and plots from the paper "nflWAR: A Reproducible Method for Offensive
Player Evaluation in Football" by Ronald Yurko, Samuel Ventura, and Maksim Horowitz. PCA files refer to our own code implementation of feature reduction techniques on the play-by-play dataset. Other plots are original novelty analysis of the nflWAR correlations based on results from the paper.
